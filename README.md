-  Hi, I’m Blue!
-  I’m interested in birds, and really most things in general.
-  I’m currently learning how to code, just in general.
-  I’m trying to figure out how to make my own game about one of my OC's. Let's see if I can figure it out!
-  Pronouns: They/He/It
-  Fun fact: I've never broken a bone!
